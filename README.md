### INTRODUCTION
## PROJECT BACKGROUND
This project is an end-of-course project, at the end of this course, I've gained significant expertise in Microsoft Excel, mastering techniques to organize data for analysis effectively. This project entails crafting a comprehensive summary of sales figures for Adventure Works, comparing first-quarter results between 2022 and 2023. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in creating formulas to calculate total sales, percentage increases, and month-by-month breakdowns. By leveraging Excel's functionalities, I aim to deliver a detailed report that provides valuable insights into sales performance, aiding in strategic decision-making and cleaning data for further analysis. This endeavour showcases my ability to manipulate data and generate meaningful insights, highlighting my competence in data analysis and reporting.

# Problem
The task involves restructuring and analyzing sales data for Adventure Works, focusing on the first quarter's performance for two consecutive years. The existing dataset contains information on product sales in a raw and disorganized form, including wholesale and retail prices, quantities sold, and order dates. The objective is to create comprehensive cleaned-up data that highlights total sales, monthly breakdowns, and year-over-year comparisons and is ready for further analysis as well.

# Data source
The primary data set used for this clean-up exercise is the raw Excel sheet file obtained from my Coursera course module.

# Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- MS Word - report writing and visualization [Download here](https://microsoft.com)

# Cleaning methodology
The process of achieving a perfect summary for the quarter one report involves narrowing down blank spaces within the columns of the sheet by the use of the TRIM function in Excel, cleaning up improper headings, adjusting fonts where necessary, background colours and also merging and centring text where necessary.
The use “PROPER” function for accurately organizing text made the worksheet look more presentable. Other clean-up functions used for this exercise included the use of SUMIF and percentage functions to add more meaning to the end product of the data-cleaning exercise.
At the end of the day, the sales data for Adventure Works was cleaned and ready for further analysis/presentation.
